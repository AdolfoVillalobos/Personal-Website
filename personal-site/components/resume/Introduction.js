          Hello! I&#39;m Adolfo, a data scientist and mathematical engineer. I am passionate about
          solving complex engineering problems leveraging data-driven technologies. I love to
          implement solutions that provide insight into the core of the problem and ultimately
          add value by allowing decision making and actionability.
        </p>
        <p className="intro-p">
          I enjoy being the bridge between engineering and design, and feel
          right at home as an analyst and back-end engineer. I&#39;m experienced in
          developing and designing products from simple landing pages to
          full-fledged web apps.
